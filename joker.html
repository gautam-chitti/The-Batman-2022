            The Joker is a deranged serial killer and a dangerous enemy of the Batman, having been apprehended by him sometime during his first active year. He became an inmate at the Arkham State Hospital and was later visited by the Caped Crusader, as he attempted to profile the motives of the infamous serial killer, Riddler, whom Joker later befriended.
