            The son of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne is a <strong>billionaire</strong> orphan. His parents were murdered by some assassin's of <strong>Carmine Falcone</strong>. He is not seen in public or his office usually. His butler Alfred is his father figure. His latest appearance was on the Funeral of the <strong>Mayor.</strong> We wonder what does he do with all his time.
